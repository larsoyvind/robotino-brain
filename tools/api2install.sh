Unsupported distribution!

This installation script has been written for and tested on Ubuntu (14.04 LTS),
and will possibly work for other Debian/Ubuntu derivatives (which should not
generate this message).

You can run the script anyway, but for the script to work you will have to
provide the dependencies yourself (these will be listed in the next dialog).
(This has been tested and is working on Arch Linux.)

The api2 for Robotino will now be installed:
Install dir: $APIDIR
Temp dir: $TMPDIR 
After the installation symlinks will be created in system folders making
compilation and linking work as if the API was installed from a system package.
This will require root privileges.

During the installation, the following dependencies and any dependecies they
might have will also be installed:
